# Why evil? #

Perhaps the better question is, "why not?"

For the origins of Evil Hillary, however, and her distinction from Hillary's evil twin, Yrallih, one must look back to those distant days of September 14-18, 2020. Then, during a virtual training, the instructor, Kristina Nairn, called for a volunteer and the illustrious personage known as Evil Hillary was born.

Evil Hillary is quite clever and, if not for cryptographic standards, would be known for intercepting and altering documents during transmission.
